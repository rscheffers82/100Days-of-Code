### Day 7: January 7th, 2017 (Webpack exploration)

**Today's Progress:**
Managed to finish the first part of a webpack tutorial.

**Thoughts:**
Having used webpack for several React projects. I did not fully understand how to create a `webpack.config.js` file. Some code within it made sense, while other parts were like Chinese to me. Creating such a file from the group up and reading up on those parts helped to wrap my head around the various options in there. For future projects, I now know which parts to include and which to leave out.

### Day 6: January 6th, 2017 (Update portfolio website)

**Today's Progress:**
Made some improvements to my portfolio website

**Thoughts:**
It was nice to fiddle around again with some CSS and make things look nice on the screen. The last few days I've worked more with code and backend stuff, so this was a nice change. I also worked on updating the description of some projects so they highlight the things I learned and which technologies I used.

### Day 5: January 5th, 2017 (Spontaneous bug fix day)

**Today's Progress:**
Felt the need to bugfix an older app

**Thoughts:**
I've build this little app on codepen a while ago to determine which numerological day the current day adds up to. I had some bugs for certain days, so fixed those bugs and ran some tests. Thinking of adding react to the app and several views, today, monthly overview, search.

### Day 4: January 4th, 2017 (Worked on boilerplate API auth server)

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the API auth server.

**Thoughts:**
Wrestled quite a bit with passport and the setup of strategies. Luckily, I had enough time on my hands to sit down with the code and make it work. <i>#feelingsatisfied</i>

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2017 (Express and NodeJS authentication)

**Today's Progress:**
Created new repo and setup a fair chunck of the server and user authentication using Express and NodeJS

**Thoughts:**
Definitely enjoyed working with the backend and I love those moments when things start to work. Luckily I had a few hours of undisturbed coding time which helped to get my mind around some of the new concepts.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017 (Redux middleware)

**Today's Progress:**
Managed to code a couple of hours and explore redux middleware

**Thoughts:**
Wrapping a function into a function into a function is mind boggling but at least I understand how to tap into middleware and add it to React-redux.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2017 (Explore higher order components in React)

**Today's Progress:**
Created a simple component in React and added functionality to it by creating a higher order component and wrapping this around it.

**Thoughts:**
This upcoming week I want to get more familiar with React and Redux and will pick up a few projects along the way to put into practice what I'm studying.
