### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017 (Redux middleware)

**Today's Progress**: Managed to code a couple of hours and explore redux middleware

**Thoughts**: Wrapping a function into a function into a function is mind boggling but at least I understand how to tap into middleware and add it to React-redux.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2017 - Explore higher order components in React

**Today's Progress**: Created a simple component in React and added functionality to it by creating a higher order component and wrapping this around it.

**Thoughts:** This upcoming week I want to get more familiar with React and Redux and will pick up a few projects along the way to put into practice what I'm studying.
