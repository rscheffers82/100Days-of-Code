### Day 4: January 4th, 2017 (Worked on boilerplate API auth server)

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the API auth server.

**Thoughts:**
Wrestled quite a bit with passport and the setup of strategies. Luckily, I had enough time on my hands to sit down with the code and make it work. <i>#feelingsatisfied</i>

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2017 (Express and NodeJS authentication)

**Today's Progress:**
Created new repo and setup a fair chunck of the server and user authentication using Express and NodeJS

**Thoughts:**
Definitely enjoyed working with the backend and I love those moments when things start to work. Luckily I had a few hours of undisturbed coding time which helped to get my mind around some of the new concepts.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017 (Redux middleware)

**Today's Progress:**
Managed to code a couple of hours and explore redux middleware

**Thoughts:**
Wrapping a function into a function into a function is mind boggling but at least I understand how to tap into middleware and add it to React-redux.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2017 (Explore higher order components in React)

**Today's Progress:**
Created a simple component in React and added functionality to it by creating a higher order component and wrapping this around it.

**Thoughts:**
This upcoming week I want to get more familiar with React and Redux and will pick up a few projects along the way to put into practice what I'm studying.
